# Using CleanRL at Hugging Face

[CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) is a Deep Reinforcement Learning library that provides high-quality single-file implementation with research-friendly features.

## Exploring Stable-Baselines3 in the Hub

You can find CleanRL models by filtering at the left of the [models page](https://huggingface.co/models?library=cleanrl).

All models on the Hub come up with useful features:
1. An automatically generated model card with a description, a training configuration, and more.
2. Metadata tags that help for discoverability.
3. A video widget where you can watch your agent performing.
