# Adding a new dataset

The [Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets) is home to an extensive collection of community-curated and popular research datasets. We encourage you to share your dataset to the Hub to help grow the ML community and accelerate progress for everyone. All contributions are welcome; adding a dataset is just a drag and drop away!

Start by [creating a Hugging Face Hub account](https://huggingface.co/join) if you don't have one yet.

## Upload with the Hub UI

The Hub's web-based interface allows users without any developer experience to upload a dataset.

### Create a repository

A repository hosts all your dataset files, including the revision history, making storing more than one dataset version possible.

1. Click on your profile and select **New Dataset** to create a new dataset repository. 
2. Pick a name for your dataset, and choose whether it is a public or private dataset. A public dataset is visible to anyone, whereas a private dataset can only be viewed by you or members of your organization.

### Upload dataset

1. Once you've created a repository, navigate to the **Files and versions** tab to add a file. Select **Add file** to upload your dataset files. We support many text, audio, and image data extensions such as `.csv`, `.mp3`, and `.jpg` among many others. For text data extensions like `.csv`, `.json`, `.jsonl`, and `.txt`, we recommend compressing them before uploading to the Hub (to `.zip` or `.gz` file extension for example).

    Text file extensions are not tracked by Git LFS by default, and if they're greater than 10MB, they will not be committed and uploaded. Take a look at the `.gitattributes` file in your repository for a complete list of tracked file extensions. For this tutorial, you can use the following sample `.csv` files since they're small: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/stevhliu/demo/raw/main/train.csv" download>train.csv</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/stevhliu/demo/raw/main/test.csv" download>test.csv</a>.

2. Drag and drop your dataset files and add a brief descriptive commit message.

3. After uploading your dataset files, they are stored in your dataset repository.

### Create a Dataset card

Adding a Dataset card is super valuable for helping users find your dataset and understand how to use it responsibly.

1. Click on **Create Dataset Card** to create a Dataset card. This button creates a `README.md` file in your repository.

<div class="flex justify-center">

</div>

2. At the top, you'll see the **Metadata UI** with several fields to select from like license, language, and task categories. These are the most important tags for helping users discover your dataset on the Hub. When you select an option from each field, they'll be automatically added to the top of the dataset card.

    You can also look at the [Dataset Card specifications](https://github.com/huggingface/hub-docs/blob/main/datasetcard.md?plain=1), which has a complete set of (but not required) tag options like `annotations_creators`, to help you choose the appropriate tags.

</div>

3. Click on the **Import dataset card template** link at the top of the editor to automatically create a dataset card template. Filling out the template is a great way to introduce your dataset to the community and help users understand how to use it. For a detailed example of what a good Dataset card should look like, take a look at the [CNN DailyMail Dataset card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail).

### Dataset Viewer

The [Dataset Viewer](./datasets-viewer) is crucial to know what the data actually look like.
You can [configure it](./datasets-viewer-configure) and specify which files to show and how they should be shown.

## Using Git

Since model repos are just Git repositories, you can use Git to push your model files to the Hub. Follow the guide on [Getting Started with Repositories](repositories-getting-started) to learn about using the `git` CLI to commit and push your models.

## Using the `huggingface_hub` client library

The rich feature set in the `huggingface_hub` library allows you to manage repositories, including creating repos and uploading models to the Model Hub. Visit [the client library's documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/index) to learn more.

## Using other libraries

Some libraries [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) or [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) can upload files to the Hub.
See the list of [Libraries supported by the Datasets Hub](./datasets-libraries.md) for more information.

## Using Git

Since dataset repos are just Git repositories, you can use Git to push your data files to the Hub. Follow the guide on [Getting Started with Repositories](repositories-getting-started) to learn about using the `git` CLI to commit and push your datasets.
